        Hey guys,  welcome back to the new video. This is the second part of mac os installation on your laptop using the open core method.This is Abid, you are watching tech twist let’s get started.
               So this is the VM ware we created in the last video, before beginning with the creation of Mac OS bootable USB let me tell you that you need to go through open core guide once to properly understand this otherwise it will be very tough for you guys to follow on this video now i’ll be linking all those files that i mention in this video in the description so make sure you go there and download it from there. Now first we’ll open gib Mac OS master then here you should see gib Mac OS command double click on it. So here you can see that this is Mac OS catalina 10.15.7(19h4) and it is currently the latest one and it has 8.75 GB. So what we will do is type 1 here and press enter but i won’t download it now because i have already downloaded this so i will just quit it, and if you head to Mac OS download and public release, Mac Os catalina 	you should see all these files, but we have to create the Mac OS installer now what we’ll do is go back and click on build MAC OS install dot command double click on it and here paste the folder where we downloaded, so here we will go to public release here you can see that that this is the Mac Os catalina folder now we will just drag it and press enter now you can see that it has created Mac OS base system which to create to create a bootable USB, next what we’ll do is take a 16 GB or more pendrive plug it in once you have connected it make sure that you connect to virtual machine, select your virtual machine and click on ok.
                                               	   	                                 Now go to disk utility now you can see that the external device which is AI mass storage is here click on erase and make sure  you name it as my volume, format is Mac OS extended (journaled) and scheme is GUID partition map click on erase. Now once it has finished erasing close the disk utility and go to the folder of Mac OS catalina and here you should see install Mac OS catalina what we need to do is drag it applications folder and it’ll copy into the applications folder so here you can see that install Mac OS catalina is here so now once this has finished copying what we need to do is open terminal and here paste the command now this command will be in the description so make sure you copy it from there now it will ask for a password enter the password that you created during the installation of Mac OS now while typing it won’t show you the password just type the password and press enter it will ask do you want to erase the usb press Y and enter nowhere you can see that it is erasing our diak this might take 5 to 10 minutes depending how fast is your USB and after that it will start creating the bootable USB installer nowhere you can see that it has finished erasing our USB also it is creating our bootable USB now this might take around 20 to 25 minutes and you might feel like it got stuck but please be patient and let it do it’s work so i’ll be back once it has finished creating bootable USB. 
          	                                                                     Now here you can see that the install Mac OS catalina is completed so our bootable USB has been created now. Now what we need to do is create an EFI folder for installing it into our normal window’s laptop so for that what we’ll naeed is an efi folder, for that you need to go to builts| ania here select product click on open core package and in 0.6.3 select the latest one, let’s just drag it now open up the EFI folder go to OC, kexts and in the description you will find link to these two folders one is ssdts and second one is kexts so open up the kexts here copy all the kexts open the kext folder in the EFI folder and paste them here then let’s just close this go back and in the ACPI section open the stds folder copy all the ssdts and paste it here then again open the EFI folder here in the oc you will find the config.plist now i won’t show you how to config the config.plist because it depends on your system and also the ssts you might require might change according to your system so what i recommend is go to the open core guide and here you can see all the generations of the laptop so i have a whiskey lake so i’ll select this and if you go to acpi scroll down a bit and here you will find the ssdts in the same way you find the ssdts for your generation so make sure you download that and also the kexts might change according to your laptops hardware so make sure you know what hardware you have and if you go here in the coffee lake and whiskey lake it will show you how to config your config.plist so if i explain it in the video it might be a quite long process and it might not work for all so make sure you read this guide properly then configure your config.plist, this way you will be able to easily configure your config.plist but now i will show you how to capture all the ssdts and kexts that we placed in acpi and kexts section so for that you will need to open open tree master double click on proper tree . command click file open and now we have placed our EFI folder so now we will go into our EFI folder, OC, and open the config. Plist here now you can see that this is the config. Plist now this might seem a bit difficult  to you but if you read the open guide properly it will be very easy.
                                                                       Now what we need to do is go to file click on OC snapshot now here make sure that you select your OC folder from the EFI folder go to EFI and select the OC folder and click on choose now as  you can see that it has already populated all the files that we copied and make sure that in enable section it should be set to true otherwise it is no use of adding them because they are disabled so make sure you cross check that it is enabled and also if you scroll down a bit all our kext has been added and now assuming that you have already config your config.plist so what we need to do is save it for that we need to go to file and click on save. Now it will save just open clover configurator it will also  be linked  in the description now go to mount EFI and here you should see EFI on install Mac OS catalina click on mount partition enter your password now click on open partition here you can see that the EFI partition is empty so what we need to do is copy the EFI folder that we created just now  to this section now we have successfully created our bootable USB pendrive what we need to do is just start installing it.
       	 		  	So let’s restart our pc now once it has restarted go to your bios, here go to advanced, make sure that VTD is didabled then in the USB configuration USB mass storage driver is enabled graphic configuration make sure that DVMT pre-allocated is set to 64 MB go back go to sata configuration and sata mode selection should be AHCI otherwise you won’t able to see your disk while installation then go to boot , here make sure that fast boot is disabled go to security , secure boot and secure coot control should be disabled now go to save and exit now once your pc has restarted go to boot menu here select the USB pen drive and select install Mac OS catalina ,so now the boot process has started this might take around 5 to 7 minutes depending on how fast is your USB and pc now here it is asking to plug in a mouse as the trackpad won’t work properly during the installation so make sure you have an extra USB mouse now let’s just press this continue  so now we are into our MAC OS utilities go to disk utility here select the hard disk or ssd on which you want to install Mac OS so i want to install it on a ssd so i will select it make sure you select the whole ssd not the partition and click on erase name it whatever you want make sure the format id is changed into APFS and the scheme is guid partition map click on erase lets just close this click on install Mac OS , her eselect the drive on which you want to install Mac OS and now you can see that about 3 minutes remaining, so now once the installation is completed it will restart what you need to do is again select the USB pen drive and here select Mac OS installer , now it will again start the installation process and again take 20 to 25 minutes so just be patient and let it install so here you can see that the Mac OS installation has started again and this will again take 20 to 25 minutes so let’s just be patient and let it install.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 So her you can see that the installation is completed now now once again it will reboot, go to your boot menu and again select your pendrive then again select mac and now it has started booting up again so it is it’s first and it might take a few minutes please be patient and let it install now let's start setting up this mac and here you can see that we have finished setting up our Mac and it has installed properly in our windows laptop now let’s go to about this this Mac here you can see that intel core i5 cord core 8GB ram my GPU is also properly detected so i have full graphic acceleration  no glitches nothing now we need to fix some things like booting our mac with out USB fixing our track pad getting the back lid key board and a couple of few more changes like audio, and wifi, so that will be covered in the next part of the video and inlokking into the response to this video if you guys kike this hit the like button if you are new to my make sure you subscribe my channel and if you have any errors make sure to comment or you directly in email me through the e mail given inthe description.
